          <h3>Dipping my toes</h3>
          <p>Appropriately named, Spring Awakening was my first full dance music festival. Slotted in early June in a suburb outside of Chicago, the 2019 lineup was one for the books. It was nearly wasted on me, as I was only brushing familiar with the current zeitgeist of dance music and its big players. In fact, a single artist, Zedd, had been the tipping point for buying tickets for the first place. It was very fortunate that I’d decided to go in for a penny, in for a pound, and bought the full 3-day GA ticket. While I’d been to single day rock and metal festivals, I didn’t quite know what I was in for…</p>

          <h4>Making the Approach</h3>
          <p>Approaching the grounds (buried in a corporate park), I felt what seasoned rave-goers have come to hold as the sensation of returning home: earth-moving bass. From the moment the gates cracked open, stages sent vibrations all the way back to the parking lot. The energy was contagious and unavoidable. There were smiles, bright and glittery clothing, and groups from all over the country coming together and rushing inside to get the party started.</p>

          <h4>The Grounds</h3>
          <p>Spring Awakening boasts 3 stages of music with separate disciplines: House/Techno, Bass Music, and a Mainstage slinging a bit of everything with a heavy dose of the pop side of EDM. Littered in between stages were the various psychedelic shops, food trucks, and a few carnival rides for good measure. But to be frank, these should only be temporary distractions from the packed dancefloors.</p>

          <h4>The Music</h3>
          <p>Being only a casual dance music listener, the name of the game for this festival was just to take it all in. Besides a few names and set times that I’d logged, it was a wonderful game of musical chairs. 30 minutes of groovy house music here, 45 minutes of headbanging at the Bass Stage. Sunset coming up? Better make your way to the mainstage for the lightshow of the night. Veritable dance music superstars like Martin Garix and Illenium played sets that weekend, but they went right over my head as I blissfully bounced from stage to stage, taking in all there was to be offered. A word to the wise: pack comfy shoes! I don’t think I stopped dancing for the 24 cumulative hours I spent on the campus.</p>

          <h4>Why I’ll be back</h3>
          <p>Admittedly, dance music can be divisive. Not everyone gets on board with the robotic beep-boop music from the get go. My argument to those folks is to go, just once, to a festival day, because there is a hole left in dance music when you have no one to dance with! Complete strangers became comrades in the neon lights, sharing water and sunscreen, matching your wacky dance moves, becoming instant kin whose hearts align with the beat. It is not only a crowd that encourages you to express yourself, but welcomes you to be bold and brash in a way that just doesn’t exist outside these walls. The music is amazing, but as with most passions, it's the people who guaranteed I’d be coming back for more.</p>
