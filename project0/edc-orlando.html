          <h3>Crème de la crème</h3>
          <p> EDC, short for Electric Daisy Carnival, is a festival held in locations all over the world including Korea, Mexico, and the headlining event boasting 400,000+ attendees taking place in Las Vegas.
            EDC Orlando was my first exposure to what a top tier festival can be. With an intricate nature theme, EDC’s campus detailing leaves little to be desired. And armed with the experience of my first festival earlier that summer, Spring Awakening, I was ready to hit the ground running.

          <h3>The Stages</h3>
          <p>Being the most attended EDM festival comes with its perks, chief among is a large budget. Each year at the start of the summer festival season, Insomniac reveals their designs for the year’s EDC stages in Las Vegas, then taking variations on tour across the globe. To give an idea of the extravagance, a report from 2016 tells that the main stage (the largest of the 7 built for Vegas) cost $3 Million dollars. Not an expense spared, and not a dead pixel to be found.
            For Orlando, four stages made the cut: Mainstage (called kineticFIELD), the Bass stage (circuitGROUNDS), a strict house/techno stage (neonGARDEN) and a jack of all trades stage (stereoBLOOM). Insomniac must’ve known I had a steps-goal, as they placed my two favorite stages on opposite ends of the grounds. Running back and forth between circuitGROUNDS and kineticFIELD, I was a fish in a sea of glitterbombed party-goers.

          <h3>The Music</h3>
          <p>EDC lineups are nothing short of legendary, and there were so many names I was excited to see. Deadmau5, Diplo, and Steve Aoki are some of the recognizable names I was excited to see, as well as lesser known acts like Jauz and REZZ.
            But as is often the case with a venue hosting three full days of music, the real joy was discovering new favorites. A new found friend insisted we catch Wax Motif spin house hits, and the rising acid-techno star i_o put on a fantastic daytime set.

          <h3>New Friends</h3>
          <p> As an admitted introvert, it’s tough enough to make new friends. However, having experienced the welcoming nature of the dance music scene, I made it a personal goal to meet new people and gain new friends. Sure enough, even before boarding the bus to the grounds, I’d chatted up with a group who’d all met years ago at a different festival, and I was welcomed with open arms to the group. We’d end up spending the entire weekend together, even combining yet again with a brand new group totaling 12 new friends. We stay in touch today, with plans to make a big comeback when the world opens up again.
